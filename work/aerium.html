quote: A business is only as successful as the team it has behind it. From management and vision to teams and relationships itâ€™s chemestry that really determines the success of a business.

description: We began this project looking looking at the services that Aerium provide and narrowing them down to four key problems that they address. The core of the site was based around helping potential clients find the solutions to their problems quickly and in a conversational method. This invovled creating several custom post types in wordpress to make sorting quick and easy for the user and updates easy for management.
